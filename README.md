# SubjectNameHere

A random generator for buzzword-laden indie gaming pitches, written in Perl.

## Data Format

Subject Name Here takes random words and phrases from a plain text file called
'buzzwords', which must be placed in the same directory as the main
subjectnamehere executable.

The format of that file should be obvious from reading it.
